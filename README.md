Layoffs Data Analysis using SQL
Overview
This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a layoffs dataset to uncover insights into the scale, distribution, and trends of layoffs across various companies, stages, and countries. The analysis aims to identify key patterns and provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing layoffs in different contexts.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes key information such as:

Company: The name of the company where layoffs occurred.
Total Laid Off: The number of employees affected by the layoffs.
Percentage Laid Off: The proportion of the workforce that was laid off.
Funds Raised: The amount of funding the company raised before the layoffs, measured in millions.
Date: The date on which the layoffs took place.
Country: The country where the layoffs occurred.
Stage: The stage of the company (e.g., Seed, Series A, Public) at the time of the layoffs.
Key Insights
1. Comprehensive Data Overview
The analysis begins with a full retrieval of the dataset to understand the scope and scale of layoffs across all records.
2. Layoff Extremes
By identifying the maximum number of layoffs and the highest percentage of workforce reductions, the analysis highlights the most significant layoffs in the dataset.
3. 100% Workforce Layoffs
Special attention is given to companies that laid off their entire workforce, providing insights into the scale and financial backgrounds of these companies.
4. Layoffs by Company and Country
Aggregating layoffs by company and country offers a clear view of which entities and regions were most affected, enabling a deeper understanding of the impact across different geographical and organizational contexts.
5. Trends Over Time
By analyzing layoffs on a monthly and yearly basis, the project identifies temporal trends and patterns, helping to uncover periods of increased layoff activity and possible correlations with external events.
6. Rolling Totals and Cumulative Impact
Calculating rolling totals of layoffs over time provides a cumulative view of the impact, allowing for a better understanding of how layoffs have accumulated over specific periods.
7. Stage-Wise Analysis
Understanding layoffs based on the company's stage offers insights into which stages of development are more vulnerable to workforce reductions, whether in early-stage startups or more established public companies.
8. Top Companies by Layoffs
The analysis ranks companies by the total number of layoffs, identifying the top entities responsible for the most significant workforce reductions each year.
Insights and Visualizations
The results of this analysis offer valuable insights into the dynamics of layoffs, including the identification of companies and regions most affected, temporal trends, and stage-specific vulnerabilities. These findings can be visualized using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python to create dashboards that effectively communicate the impact and distribution of layoffs.

Future Directions
Future analysis could delve deeper into the factors influencing layoffs, such as economic conditions, industry performance, or funding cycles. Additionally, predictive modeling could be employed to forecast potential future layoffs based on historical data and emerging trends.
